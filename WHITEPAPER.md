## Executive Summary

Agoraphobia is a free-to-play, open-source tower defense game designed to serve as Gorbagana's universal onramp. Players defend their junkyard from dumpster divers using trash-built weapons, earning TrashCoin (universal scoring) or any Gorbagana-native token.

**Monetization Model:**
- Free game with unlimited play and in-game store
- Optional $0.99 wallet upgrade unlocks real crypto withdrawals

**Dual-Track Architecture:**
- Gaming track: Free mobile game targeting mainstream adoption
- Crypto track: Token marketplace enabling multiple Gorbagana-native tokens

**Global Crypto Adoption Challenges (2025):**
- Less than 10% of 5.44B internet users own crypto

**Gorbagana's Challenge:** A whale-heavy network requires broader distribution to achieve sustainable network effects.
